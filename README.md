Jellyfin is a Free Software Media System that puts you in control of managing and streaming your media. It is an alternative to the proprietary Emby and Plex, to provide media from a dedicated server to end-user devices via multiple apps. Jellyfin is descended from Emby's 3.5.2 release and ported to the .NET Core framework to enable full cross-platform support. There are no strings attached, no premium licenses or features, and no hidden agendas: just a team who want to build something better and work together to achieve it. We welcome anyone who is interested in joining us in our quest!

This repository contains packaging for Jellyfin 10.9.0 and above, for use by manual builders or the CI system with GitHub workflows.

Inside this repository are 6 major components:

1. Submodules for the `jellyfin` and `jellyfin-web` repositories. These are dynamic submodules; while the repo has them committed at a given version, this is only updated on an official release build. Note that for simplicity, the `jellyfin` repo is in a folder here called `jellyfin-server`.

2. Debian/Ubuntu packaging configurations (under `debian`). These will build the 3 Jellyfin packages (`jellyfin` metapackage, `jellyfin-server` core server, and `jellyfin-web` web client). Future packages (e.g. Vue) may be added here if and when they are promoted to a production build alongside the others.

3. Fedora/CentOS packaging configurations (under `fedora`). These will build the same packages as Debian.

4. Docker image builders. Like the above two as well, only building the combined Docker images.

5. Script infrastructure to handle coordinating builds from the main repos on a release trigger.

6. The GitHub Actions CI to build all the above.
